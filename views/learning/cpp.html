			<h2>What is C++?</h2>
			<p>
				C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an
				extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain
				scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.

				C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features.
				Initially, the language was called "C with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional
				concept of "classes." However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.

				It is pronounced "see-plus-plus."

			<h3>Learning</h3>
			<p>
				Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new
				programming language is Hello, World! So let's write it in C++ now!
				<!-- This paragraph from https://groklearning.com/learn/intro-python-1/intro-to-programming/0/ -->
				<br>
				<br>
				<!-- Source: https://www.learn-cpp.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21 -->
				Every C++ program uses libraries, which give the ability to execute necessary functions. For example, the most basic
				function called 'cout', which prints to the screen, is defined in the iostream header file.

				To add the ability to run the cout command to our program, we must add following include directive to our first line of
				the code:
				<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;</code>
				</pre>
				The second part of the code is the actual code which we are going to write. The first code which will run will always
				reside in the main function.
				<pre>
<code>
int main() {
	cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!";
}</code>
				</pre>
				The int keyword indicates that the function main will return an integer - a simple number. The number which will be
				returned by the function indicates whether the program that we wrote worked correctly. If we want to say that our code
				was run successfully, we will return the number 0. A number greater than 0 will mean that the program that we wrote
				failed.

				For this tutorial, we will return 0 to indicate that our program was successful:
				<pre>
<code>
return 0;</code>
				</pre>

						A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C++ has a specific type,
						which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that
						memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

						The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a
						letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C++ is case-sensitive −
					</p>
					<div class="card-text body">
						A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with the given type and
						name so that compiler proceed for further compilation without needing complete detail about the variable. A variable
						declaration has its meaning at the time of compilation only, compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of
						linking of the program.

						A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files
						which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use extern keyword to declare a variable at any
						place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C++ program, but it can be defined only once in a file,
						a function or a block of code.

						Example
						Try the following example where a variable has been declared at the top, but it has been defined inside the main
						function −
						<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Variable declaration:
extern int a, b;
extern int c;
extern float f;

int main () {
	// Variable definition:
	int a, b;
	int c;
	float f;

	// actual initialization
	a = 10;
	b = 20;
	c = a + b;

	cout << c << endl;
	f=70.0/3.0; 
	cout << f << endl;
	return 0;
}</code>
						</pre>
	
						When the above code is compiled and executed, it
						produces the following result − 
						<pre>
<code>
30
23.3333</code>

						<!-- Source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_if_else_statement.htm -->
						An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.
						<h6>Syntax</h6>
						The syntax of an if...else statement in C++ is −
						<pre>
<code>
if(boolean_expression) {
// statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true
} else {
// statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false
}</code>
						</pre>
						If the boolean expression evaluates to true, then the if block of code will be executed, otherwise else block of code
						will be executed.
						<br><br>
						An if statement can be followed by an optional else if...else statement, which is very usefull to test various
						conditions using single if...else if statement.
						When using if , else if , else statements there are few points to keep in mind.
						<ol>
							<li>
								An if can have zero or one else's and it must come after any else if's.
							</li>
							<li>
								An if can have zero to many else if's and they must come before the else.
							</li>
							<li>
Once an else if succeeds, none of he remaining else if's or else's will be tested.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h6>Syntax</h6>
						The syntax of an if...else if...else statement in C++ is −
						<pre>
<code>
if(boolean_expression 1) {
	// Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true
} else if( boolean_expression 2) {
	// Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true
} else if( boolean_expression 3) {
	// Executes when the boolean expression 3 is true
} else {
	// executes when the none of the above condition is true.

					<h5 class="card-title">Loops</h5>
					<p class="card-text">
						In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement
						in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a
						situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. Programming
						languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution
						paths. A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

						<h4>Types</h4>
						There are is three of types of loops in C++. These include:
						<ul>
							<li>For loops</li>
							<li>While loops</li>
							<li>Do while loops (not covered here)</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>While loops</h5>
						<!-- source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_while_loop.htm -->
						A while loop statement repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

						<h6>Syntax</h6>
						The syntax of a while loop in C++ is −
						<pre>
<code>
while(condition) {
	statement(s);
}</code>
						</pre>
						Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is
						any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.
						When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
						<br>
						<br>
						<h5>For loops</h5>
						<!-- source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_for_loop.htm -->
						A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a
						specific number of times.

						<h6>Syntax</h6>
						The syntax of a for loop in C++ is −
						<pre>
<code>
for ( init; condition; increment ) {
	statement(s);
}</code>
						</pre>
						Here is the flow of control in a for loop −
						<ol>
							<li>
								The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control
								variables. You are not required to put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop
								does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for loop.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop
								does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for loop.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop
								does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for loop.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								After the body of the for loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement. This statement
								can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the condition.
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of loop,
								then increment step, and then again condition). After the condition becomes false, the for loop terminates..
							</li>
							<br>
						</ol>
