				<h2>What is Python?</h2>
				<p>
					Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
					Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
					make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting 
					or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax 
					emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports 
					modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter 
					and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all 
					major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

				<h3>Learning</h3>
				<p>
					Traditionally, the first program you write when learning a new 
					programming language is Hello, World! So let's write it in Python now!
					<!-- This paragraph from https://groklearning.com/learn/intro-python-1/intro-to-programming/0/ -->
					<br>
					<br>
					To achieve this we must learn our first keyword. Keywords are simple words
					you can put into your script that Python already knows. The simplest keyword, 
					the one we want, is print. print has a really simple purpose, it takes an input and
					prints it out. So if I wanted to print "Hello, World!" I would write <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>.
					Executing the above code would result in "Hello, World!" apearing on my screen.

						<!-- source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm -->
						<p class="card-text">
							Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you
							create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
							Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved
							memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in
							these variables.
						</p>
						<div class="card-text body">
						Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when
						you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

						The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is
						the value stored in the variable. For example −
						<pre>
<code>
#!/usr/bin/python3

counter = 100 # An integer assignment
miles = 1000.0 # A floating point
name = "John" # A string

print(counter)
print(miles)
print(name)</code>
						</pre>
						Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively.
						This produces the following result −
						<pre>
<code>
100
1000.0
John</code>
						</pre>

						<h5 class="card-title">Conditional Statments</h5>
						<div class="card-text body">
							<!-- Source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_if_else.htm -->
							An else statement can be combined with an if statement. An else statement contains the block of code that executes if
							the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a FALSE value.
							The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following if.
							<h6>Syntax</h6>
							The syntax of the if...else statement is −

							<pre>
<code>if expression:
	statement(s)
else:
	statement(s)</code>
							</pre>
							There is also a type of statment called elif. <br><br>
							The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the
							conditions evaluates to TRUE.

							Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional. However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one
							statement, there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.
							<h6>
								Syntax
							</h6>
							<pre>
<code>
if expression1:
	statement(s)
elif expression2:
	statement(s)
elif expression3:
	statement(s)
else:
	statement(s)</code>

						<h5 class="card-title">Loops</h5>
						<p class="card-text">
							In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement 
							in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a 
							situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. Programming 
							languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution 
							paths. A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
						</p>
						<div class="card-text body">
							<!-- <h4>Types</h4> -->
							There are is two of types of loops in Python. These include:
							<ul>
								<li>For loops</li>
								<li>While loops</li>
							</ul>
							<h5>While loops</h5>
							Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the
							loop body.
							<h6>Syntax</h6>
							The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is −
							
							<pre>
<code>
while expression:
	statement(s)</code>
							</pre>
							Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is
							any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

							When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
							
							In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are
							considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.
							<br>
							<br>
							<h5>For loops</h5>
							Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.
							A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given
							condition is true.
							It has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.
							
							<h6>Syntax</h6>
							<pre>
<code>
for iterating_var in sequence:
	statements(s)</code>
							</pre>
							
							If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to
							the iterating variable iterating_var. Next, the statements block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to
							iterating_var, and the statement(s) block is executed until the entire sequence is exhausted.
